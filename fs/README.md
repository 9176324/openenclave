fs (file system)
================

This directory contains the Open Enclave file system implementations. These
include:

* **SGXFS** - Intel's protected file system.
* **HOSTFS** - The unsecure host file system.
* **MUXFS** - The multiplexed file system.
* **OEFS** - OE file system.

Overview:
---------

Open Enclave provides APIs for utilizing file systems implementations. The 
**HOSTFS** and **SGXFS** file systems are defined globally as **oe_hostfs**
and **oe_sgxfs** respectively.

File systems are used to open files and directories. For example:

```
/* Open an SGXFS file. */
FILE* stream = oe_fopen(&oe_sgxfs, "/myfile", "w");

/* Open a HOSTFS file. */
DIR* dir = oe_opendir(&oe_hostfs, "/mydir");
```

Once opened, files and directories are manipulated with the standard C 
functions as follows.

```
fwrite("hello", 1, 5, stream);

while ((ent = readdir(dir)))
{
    ...
}
```

Binding a path to a file system:
--------------------------------

All path-oriented file and directory objects must be bound to a file system
before they are manipulated. For example, **oe_fopen()** binds a path to the 
file system given by the first argument. The following example binds "/myfile" 
to the SGXFS file system.

```
FILE* stream = oe_fopen(&oe_sgxfs, "/myfile", "w");
```

Once bound, the **stream** can be passed to standard C I/O functions.

There are four ways to bind a path to a file system.

(1) By using the oe-prefixed functions, such as **oe_fopen()**, 
    **oe_opendir()**, **oe_mkdir()**, and **oe_stat()**.

(2) By using macros that redirect path-oriented functions to a particular file
    system. For example:

```
    #define fopen(...) oe_fopen(OE_FILE_SECURE_BEST_EFFORT, __VA_ARGS__)
```

    This method requires using a custom **<stdio.h>** header file.

(3) By using the **oe_fs_set_default()** function to set the default file
    system used by the standard C I/O functions. For example:

```
oe_fs_set_default(&oe_hostfs);
stream = fopen("/myfile", "r");
```

(4) By setting the multiplexing file system (**MUXFS**) as the default and
    using paths to direct to one or more file systems. For example:

```
oe_fs_set_default(&oe_muxfs);

/* Open a HOSTFS file. */
fopen("/hostfs/myfile", "r");

/* Open an SGXFS file. */
fopen("/sgxfs/myfile", "r");
```

The first method uses **explicit binding** and is the most secure. The other
methods employ **implicit binding** which makes it easier to port existing 
applications without having to retrofit all the path-oriented functions with
special oe-prefixed functions.
